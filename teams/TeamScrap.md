## Team Introduction:

Hello! We're a versatile group and our goal for this project is to develop the two-player mode for the Space Invaders game this semester.


TEAM ROLES:

Leader: Chloe Vegiga

Sub-leader: Ashley Lee

Developer
1. Melih Emir
2. Ahmad Najmi
3. Emmitt Aguirre
4. Damisola Talabi

Tester: Muhammad Haziq 


## Team Requirements: 

The overall project requirements that we're responsible for include redesigning the game to include two ships and make it more challenging for the players to work together. We'd handle the two input settings to work at the same time without conflicting with one another, and manage the collision between the two players when onscreen at the same time.


## Detailed Requirements: 
- Handle input and coordinate controls so that both players may use the same keyboard at the same time
- Manage the way the two ships will interact when onscreen and whether they'll conflict with each other (friendly fire?)
- Increase the speed of game mode to have the players work as a team against mobs
- The creation of two spaceships and have them separately co-exist on the same screen and be able to distinguish from each other    
- Decide between two health bars/one big health bar - co-op vs versus?

## Dependencies on Other Teams:
- Requirement 9 - relying on designs and variety of players and ships to differ each player and create the two ships to co-exist 
- Requirement 6 - level up design is required to include a sped-up level for co-op/versus
- Requirement 7 - differ between singleplayer and multiplayer modes, again then co-op/versus
